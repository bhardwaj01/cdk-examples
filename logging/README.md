CDK logging example
=========================

This module provides an example of logging application events to Hadoop via Flume, using
log4j as the logging API.

## Pre-requisites

Before trying this example, you need to have a Flume agent running.

First copy the CDK event serializer module into Flume's lib directory. This is necessary
since Flume 1.3.0 does not come with a HDFS sink that can write Avro data files.

```bash
sudo cp ~/.m2/repository/com/cloudera/cdk-flume-avro-event-serializer/*/cdk-flume-avro-event-serializer-*-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  /usr/lib/flume-ng/lib/
```

Next start a Flume agent with the configuration specified in `flume.properties`.

```
sudo flume-ng agent -n agent -c /etc/flume-ng/conf -f flume.properties
```

## Running

To build the project, type

```bash
mvn package
```

This creates a single JAR with all the dependencies inside for convenience.

The log data ends up in a dataset named "events". Before running the logger we need
to create the dataset on the filesystem with the following command:

```bash
java -cp target/*:target/jars/* com.cloudera.cdk.examples.logging.CreateDataset
```

You can see the dataset directory hierarchy by running

```bash
hadoop fs -ls -R /tmp/data/events
```

In particular, the schema for the events is stored in a _.metadata_ directory:

```bash
hadoop fs -cat /tmp/data/events/.metadata/schema.avsc
```

To allow Flume to write to our dataset we need to change the directory
permissions appropriately:

```
hadoop fs -chmod +w /tmp/data/events
```

Now we can run the application to do the logging.

```bash
java -cp target/*:target/jars/* com.cloudera.cdk.examples.logging.App
```

The program writes 10 log events to the logger. The events are sent to the Flume agent
over IPC, and the agent writes the events to the HDFS file sink. (Even though it is
called the HDFS sink, it can actually write to any Hadoop filesystem,
including the local filesystem.)

The Flume sink will write a temporary file in _/tmp/data/events/_. After a few seconds
the file will be renamed so it no longer has the _.tmp_ extension. Run the following
program to dump the contents of the dataset to the console:

```bash
java -cp target/*:target/jars/* com.cloudera.cdk.examples.logging.ReadDataset
```
